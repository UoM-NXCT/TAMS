# Thumbnail

This widget was created as the Qt6 built-in image widgets are frustrating to use. When displaying images in this application, use this custom thumbnail widget.

Improvements over the built-in image widgets:

- Maintains the aspect ratio of the image.
- Allows for dynamic resizing of the image.
- Will automatically fill its containing widget.
