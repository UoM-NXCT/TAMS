# Documentation

This is the documentation directory for this project. To use, either read the rst files
directly, build the documentation using Sphinx, or view the documentation
[online](https://tams-nxct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

You can find the script to build the documentation in the scripts directory.

_Note: the build directory is not included in the repository, so you will need to build
the documentation yourself._
